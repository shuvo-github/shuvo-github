Design a scheduler with multilevel queuehaving two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time 
first algorithm (SROT)followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute.Also note that queue1 has priority thsn queue 2.
Consider the following set of processes(for reference)with their afrrival times and theCPU burst times in milliseconds.
-----------------------------------
Process   Arrival-Time    Burst-Time
P1           0               5
P2           1               3
P3           2               3
P4           4               1
